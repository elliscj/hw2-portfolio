# HW2-Portfolio

The motivation for building this project is simple; the better portfolio you have the better chance you have at getting the job you want. The best way to show a potential employer that you are ready to code for them, is by showing them you can code. Having examples of different projects that display proficiency and or excellence at different skills/languages in a huge bonus in the job-search process.

Unfortunately, being so new to the game, I have little to show in terms of skills or excellence. I am committed to maintaining and updating this code with future projects and practice websites as I learn and grow my skills.

One thing I (and so many others) love about coding is the ability to make it your own and show your personality in your work. I am eager to learn and to watch my portfolio grow with me.
