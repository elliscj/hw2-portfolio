          <p>
            My name is Cameron Ellis. I am an aspiring Software Developer based
            out of Denver CO. I have lived in the wonderful state of Colorado
            for my whole life and do not currently have any plans to leave, but
            will for the right price...wink wink. For the past 6 years I have
            worked as a Laser Technician for a company that makes laser
            engraving and cutting machines based out of Golden CO. This job was
            fun and rewarding for a time, but was not the career path I had
            hoped for, which has led me to looking for a new career in the field
            of Software Delvelopment. I am an extremely hard worker who believes
            that you get out what you put in and have an acute attention to
            detail. My favorite hobbies are motorcycle travel and golf.
            Traveling and being 'one' with the environment and your machine is
            something that not many other methods of travel give you. My dream
            trip is to ride from Alaska to Ushuaia on the southern tip of
            Argentina. And my dog Amos III, I love my dog.
